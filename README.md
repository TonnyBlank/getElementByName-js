# getElementByName-js
The getElementById method retrieves an element using its ID, while getElementsByName returns a collection of elements with the specified name. Since getElementsByName returns a list, you need to specify an index, such as [0] or [1], depending on which element you want to access. In both cases, remember to add .value if you need to retrieve the input value from the element.
